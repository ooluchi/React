Question The following are features of react
Component-based architecture: React is built around the idea of breaking down the UI into reusable components. This allows developers to build complex UIs in a modular way, making it easier to manage and maintain code.
Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. The virtual DOM is used to efficiently update only the parts of the UI that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entire UI. This helps to optimize performance and reduce rendering times.
JSX: React uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code directly within their JavaScript code. JSX makes it easier to create and manage components, as well as improving code readability.
Unidirectional data flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow architecture, where data flows in a single direction from parent components to child components. This makes it easier to manage and update the state of the UI, as well as reducing the risk of bugs and errors.
React Native: React can be used to build native mobile apps using React Native. React Native allows developers to write code in JavaScript and compile it to native code for iOS and Android platforms. This makes it easier to build cross-platform mobile apps using a single codebase, reducing development time and cost.



Question 3
Faster rendering: React's virtual DOM helps to improve the performance of web applications by rendering only the parts of the UI that have changed. 
Reusable components: React's component-based architecture allows developers to create reusable components that can be used across multiple applications. 
SEO-friendly: React is SEO-friendly because it can be easily configured to render HTML on the server side, which can be indexed by search engines. This helps to improve the discoverability and visibility of web applications on the internet.
Large community and ecosystem: React has a large and active community of developers, which has resulted in the creation of a rich ecosystem of libraries, tools, and resources. 
Cross-platform development: React can be used to build web applications, as well as native mobile applications using React Native.

Facebook owns React.

Question 5
Notable differences between HTML and JSX include:
Syntax: HTML uses angle brackets to denote tags, while JSX uses a similar syntax but allows developers to embed JavaScript expressions directly within the markup.
Attributes: HTML uses attributes to set properties of elements, while JSX uses props (short for "properties") to pass data to components.
Directives: HTML uses directives such as class and style to set CSS styles and classes, while JSX uses JavaScript objects to set styles and class names.
Browsers can't read JSX because it's not valid JavaScript syntax. JSX needs to be transpiled into regular JavaScript code that browsers can understand, which is typically done using a build tool such as Babel.
